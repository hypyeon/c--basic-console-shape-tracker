# Shape Tracker
by Hayeong Pyeon

### Description
- This app is created based on a class material and as a review of **Basic Console Apps** chapter of **C#** course provided by Epicodus. 
- The `main` branch does not work as expected since it has 3 different branches that showcase process of this app built with business logic and UI logic. 
- `.cs` files have notes and practices that are commented out for author's personal learning purpose.
